          <h2>Why is website maintenance important?</h2>
          <p>It's crucial to maintain your website to keep it safe and operating at its peak performance.

            In addition to performance concerns, avoiding your website could result in security problems, making it more susceptible to hackers who could alter it or use it to run spam links, triggering more issues with SEO, your web host, and even a decline in leads and inquiries.
            
            Optimizing for conversions and adding new functionality to your website are only two aspects of website maintenance. Security, speed, and content modifications/changes are just a few of the numerous aspects that the maintenance of your website encompasses.</p>
